      <h2>Compress string</h2> 
      <p>
        Write a JavaScript function named compressString that takes a string as its argument
        and returns a compressed version of the string following these rules:
        - For each group of consecutive identical characters in the input string, replace
        that group with a single instance of the character followed by the number of times
        it appears consecutively. <br>
        - If a character appears only once consecutively, just include the character without
        a number following it. <br>
        - The function should handle any ASCII character. <br>
        The goal is to implement a basic form of string compression for sequences of identical
        characters.
      </p>
      <p> function compressString(str) { <br>
        // Your code here <br> }
      </p>
      <p>Sample Input and Output: <br>
        Input: "aaabbc" <br>
        Output: "a3b2c" <br>
        Input: "aabbaabb" <br>
        Output: "a2b2a2b2" <br>
        Input: "abcd" <br>
        Output: "abcd" (since compressing does not reduce the string's size) <br>
        Input: "wwwwaaadexxxxxx <br>
        Output: "w4a3dex6"
      </p>
