      <h2>Form Palindrome</h2> 
      <p>
        Write a JavaScript function named canFormPalindrome that checks if it is possible to
        form a palindrome from the given input string by rearranging its letters. The function
        should return true if forming a palindrome is possible, and false otherwise. A palindrome
        is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same
        forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). <br>
        <br>
        Visual Explanation of Right Rotation: <br>
        Consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and let's rotate it to the right by 2 steps. <br>
        Initial Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] <br>
        After 1st Rotation: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4] <br>
        The last element (5) moves to the front, and all other elements move one position to the
        right. <br>
        After 2nd Rotation: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3] <br>
        Again, the new last element (4) moves to the front, and all other elements shift one
        position to the right.
      </p>
      <p> function canFormPalindrome(str) { <br>
        // Your code here <br> }
      </p>
      <p>Sample Input and Output: <br>
        Input: "carrace" <br>
        Output: true (Because "carrace" can be rearranged to "racecar", which is a palindrome.) <br>
        Input: "hello" <br>
        Output: false (Because there's no way to rearrange "hello" to form a palindrome.)
