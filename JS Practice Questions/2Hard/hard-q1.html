      <h2>Merge and Format</h2> 
      <p>
        Write a JavaScript function named mergeAndFormat that takes two parameters: an
        array of objects representing books, where each book has a title, author, and year
        properties, and a string representing a format type ("string" or "object"). The function
        should merge books with the same title and author but different years into a single entry.
        The way the books are merged should depend on the format type specified: <br>
        - If the format type is "string", the function should return an array of strings
        formatted as "Title by Author (Years)", where "Years" is a comma-separated list of
        years when the book was published. <br>
        - If the format type is "object", the function should return an array of objects, each
        object containing title, author, and a new property years which is an array of
        years.
      </p>
      <p> function mergeAndFormat(books, format) { <br>
        // Your code here <br> }
      </p>
      <p>Sample Input: <br> 
        const books = [
        { title: "The Great Gatsby", author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald", year:
        1925 },
        { title: "The Great Gatsby", author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald", year:
        2020 },
        { title: "1984", author: "George Orwell", year: 1949 },
        { title: "1984", author: "George Orwell", year: 1983 }
        ];
        const format = "string";
        mergeAndFormat(books, format)
      </p>
      <p>Sample Output: <br> 
        [
        "The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925, 2020)",
        "1984 by George Orwell (1949, 1983)"
        ]
      </p>
      <p> function mergeAndFormat(books, format) { <br>

        ];
        const format = "object";
