      <h2>Filter and transform</h2> 
      <p>
        Write a JavaScript function named filterAndTransform that takes an array of objects 
        and performs both filtering and transformation on the data. Each object in the array
        represents a person with the following properties: name, a string; age, a number; and
        hobby, a string. The function should: <br>
        <br>
        1. Filter out any person who is under 18 years old. <br>
        2. Transform the remaining objects into strings formatted as "<Name> is <Age> <br>
        years old and loves <Hobby>." <br>
        Return an array containing these formatted strings.
      </p>
      <p> function filterAndTransform(people) { <br>
        // Your code here <br> }
      </p>
      <p>Sample Input: <br> 
        const people = [
        { name: "Alice", age: 25, hobby: "painting" },
        { name: "Bob", age: 17, hobby: "coding" },
        { name: "Charlie", age: 32, hobby: "cycling" },
        { name: "Dave", age: 15, hobby: "gardening" }
        ];
        filterAndTransform(people)</p>
      <p>Sample Output: <br> 
        [
        "Alice is 25 years old and loves painting.",
        "Charlie is 32 years old and loves cycling."
        ]
