      <h2>Rotate array</h2> 
      <p>
        Write a JavaScript function named rotateArray that takes two parameters: an array of
        integers arr and a non-negative integer k, which represents the number of times the
        array elements should be rotated to the right. The function should rotate the array
        in-place, meaning you should modify the array directly without using extra space for
        another array. After performing the rotation, the function doesn't need to return anything.
        In the context of an array, "rotation" refers to moving the elements of the array around to
        new positions according to a specific rule. When we talk about rotating an array to the
        right (or clockwise), it means that each element is moved to the next position in the
        array, and the last element moves to the first position. This process is repeated a
        specified number of times (k times, in our case). <br>
        <br>
        Visual Explanation of Right Rotation: <br>
        Consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and let's rotate it to the right by 2 steps. <br>
        Initial Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] <br>
        After 1st Rotation: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4] <br>
        The last element (5) moves to the front, and all other elements move one position to the
        right. <br>
        After 2nd Rotation: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3] <br>
        Again, the new last element (4) moves to the front, and all other elements shift one
        position to the right.
      </p>
      <p> function rotateArray(arr, k) { <br>
        // Your code here <br> }
      </p>
      <p>Sample Input: <br> rotateArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 3);</p>
      <p>Sample Output: <br> [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4] </p>
