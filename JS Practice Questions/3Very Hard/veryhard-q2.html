      <h2>Traverse maze</h2> 
      <p>
        You are given a 2D grid representing a maze, where: <br>
        <br>
        ● 'S' represents the starting point. <br>
        ● 'F' represents the finish point. <br>
        ● '.' represents an open path that can be traveled. <br>
        ● '#' represents a wall that cannot be passed through. <br>
        <br>
        Write a JavaScript function named canTraverseMaze that takes two arguments: a 2D
        grid (array of strings) representing the maze, and a string of directions to attempt to
        traverse the maze. The directions are given as a string consisting of the letters 'N'
        (north), 'S' (south), 'E' (east), and 'W' (west). The function should return true if the
        directions lead from the start to the finish point without running into walls or going out of
        bounds, and false otherwise.
      </p>
      <p> function canTraverseMaze(maze, directions) { <br>
        // Your code here <br> }
      </p>
      <p>Sample Input 1: <br> 
        const maze = [
          "S.#",
          "...",
          "..F"
        ];
        const directions = "SEES";
        canTraverseMaze(maze, directions)
      </p>
      <p>Sample Output 1: <br> 
        true
      </p>
      <p>Sample Input 2: <br> 
        const maze = [
          "S.#",
          "...",
          "..F"
        ];
        const directions = "SSS";
        canTraverseMaze(maze, directions)
      </p>
      <p>Sample Output 2: <br> 
        false
      </p>
