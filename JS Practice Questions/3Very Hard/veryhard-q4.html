      <h2>Find islands</h2> 
      <p>
        Implement a JavaScript function named findIslands that counts the number of islands in
        a given 2D map. An island is defined as a group of adjacent lands, where "land" is
        represented by 1 and "water" is represented by 0. Two pieces of land are considered
        part of the same island if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally). <br>
        <br>
        Constraints: <br>
        ● The map is represented as a 2D array of integers, where 0 represents water and
        1 represents land. <br>
        ● The map can be of any size, potentially very large. <br>
        ● An island is a group of one or more 1s (lands) connected vertically or horizontally
        (but not diagonally). <br>
        ● The edges of the map are surrounded by water.
      </p>
      <p> function findIslands(map) { <br>
        // Write your code here <br> }
      </p>
      <p>Sample Input: <br> 
        const map1 = [ <br>
        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], <br>
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 1], <br>
        [1, 0, 0, 1, 1], <br>
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], <br>
        [1, 0, 1, 0, 1] <br>
        ]; <br>
        findIslands(map)
      </p>
      <p>Sample Output: 6 </p>
