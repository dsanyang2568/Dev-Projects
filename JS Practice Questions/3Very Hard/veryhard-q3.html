      <h2>Merge intervals</h2> 
      <p>
        Write a JavaScript function named mergeIntervals that merges all overlapping intervals
        from a given collection of intervals. Each interval is represented as an array of two
        numbers [start, end], where start is the beginning of the interval and end is the end of
        the interval. The function should return an array of the merged intervals in no specific
        order. Intervals that do not overlap should be included in the output as they are. <br>
        <br>
        Constraints: <br>
        ● The input is an array of intervals, where each interval is represented as an array
        of two integers [start, end]. <br>
        ● The start of an interval will always be less than or equal to the end. <br>
        ● The output should be an array of the merged intervals. <br>
        ● Intervals [start, end] and [end, nextStart] are considered contiguous and should
        be merged.
      </p>
      <p> function mergeIntervals(intervals) { <br>
        // Write your code here <br> }
      </p>
      <p>Sample Input 1: <br>
        const intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]; <br>
        mergeIntervals(intervals)
      </p>
      <p>Sample Output 1: <br> 
        [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
      </p>
      <p>Sample Input 2: <br>
        const intervals2 = [[1, 4], [4, 5]]; <br>
        mergeIntervals(intervals)
      </p>
      <p>Sample Output 2: <br> 
        [[1, 5]]
